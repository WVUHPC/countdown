The original countdown.sh script was found from below link:
http://linuxconfig.org/time-countdown-bash-script-example

Start from the second commit, Tom Xue made some modification: a progress bar was added.
Third commit, Lubos Rendek modifactions: improved full progress bar.


Script was heavily modified to provide three functions that do all the work.
Additionally, it no longer countsdown to a date, but rather gives the "walltime"
string until that date/time will occur.

Very useful for posting countdown strings to scheduled maintainance ( offline )
periods - which can be posted in startup profiles or given to users as a
command.
